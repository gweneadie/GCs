# GCs

GCs (Globular Clusters) is a project to infer parameters, cumulative mass profiles, and other properties of globular clusters. Within a Bayesian framework, the position and velocity data of stars in a GC are used to obtain a posterior distribution for the relevant model parameters in the [LIMEPY and SPES models](https://github.com/mgieles/limepy).

Eadie, Webb, & Rosenthal (2021, submitted to ApJ) is the manuscript associated with this project.
